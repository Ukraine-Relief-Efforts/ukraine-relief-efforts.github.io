## Centralized Information Guide (CIG) - [https://leaveukraine.com/](https://leaveukraine.com/)
The centralized information guide will contain information about survival, opened borders, the required documents to cross said borders. It's a global website on which all valuable information will be held for Ukrainian refugees.

## Host a Refugee
Host a refugee aims to be a small mobile friendly web app that allows people to sign up as a host (hosts the refugee) and refugees (the hosted) to sign up to find a host in specific regions.

## Missing Persons
The Missing Persons project seeks to integrate and share collected data to NPOs and agencies who can lead search efforts into the search for missing persons. 
For example: ICMP (International Commission on Missing Persons) database. 

## Missile Alerts
The missile alerts program seeks to provide a centralized stream of notifications that alert people when to move off to a shelter before air raids occur. These messages are scraped from Telegram notifications, translated into multiple languages, then published to their own dedicated threads.
